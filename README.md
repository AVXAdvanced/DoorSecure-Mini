# DoorSecure-Mini

**What??**

DoorSecure Mini is a program written in JavaScript in Microsoft's MakeCode that you can install on your Calliope Mini, so it can warn you when the door it's attached to opens. Your Calliope will make an alarm sound and show an exclamation point in red.

**How??** 

This works because the Calliope Mini constantly checks its accelerometer. If it detects a variation in its values, the alarm goes off. When it starts up, it performs a self-test and a calibration to determine its baseline values. Please **DO NOT** move the Calliope while it is calibrating. 

Your Calliope Mini must be attached to a door and it should be flat against it. We recommend you use the battery pack that came with it and also attach it to the door, but the power supply is up to you.

**Requirements**

The program is tested on a Calliope Mini v2. Compatibility with other Calliope Mini models may vary. It might work or it might not.

Here's an overview:

- Calliope Mini (v2)
- Some Form of Portable Power Supply
- Some way to attach the Calliope to a door
- A computer
- A micro USB to (whatever port your computer has) Cable
